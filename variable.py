#A variable in Python is a name or label that refers to data stored in memory. It's a container that stores a value, which could be a number, string, or even more complex data like lists and dictionaries.
#Examples of valid variable names:
x, name, my_variable, userAge
#Examples of invalid variable names:
123abc (cannot start with a number), for (reserved keyword)

#Example:
                                          
age = 25
name = "Alice"
height = 5.6

#Example of Variable Usage:
# Assigning values to variables
length = 10
width = 5
area = length * width  # Performing a calculation using variables

# Displaying the result
print("The area is:", area)  
# Output: The area is: 50
