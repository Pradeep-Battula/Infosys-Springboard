Module 1: Data Preprocessing & EDA

-->Download and preprocess air quality datasets.(CPCB, Open AQ)

-Datasets:

1.CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board, India)

2.OpenAQ (global open-source air quality data)

-Steps:

-Data acquisition

1.Download CSV/JSON files from CPCB (usually available city-wise).

2.Use requests or openaq API wrapper to fetch OpenAQ data.

-Data cleaning

1.Handle missing values (NaN, negative values, or extreme outliers).

2.Convert timestamps to datetime.

3.Standardize column names (pm25, pm10, no2, etc.).

4.Merge CPCB & OpenAQ if needed.

-->Conduct EDA to understand pollutant trends and correlations.

Goals: Identify pollutant levels, daily/seasonal patterns, and correlations.

-Steps:

1.Summary statistics

.describe(), missing values count, pollutant-wise averages.

2.Trend visualization

Plot pollutant concentrations over time (lineplot).
Compare seasonal trends (summer vs. winter).
Check daily/hourly patterns (rush-hour peaks).

3.Pollutant correlations

Use corr() & heatmaps.

-->Resample data and prepare features for forecasting.

Air quality data is often at hourly/minute level → need consistent time steps.

-Steps:

1.Resample to hourly/daily averages

2.Feature engineering

Lag features (past pollutant levels).
Rolling means (moving average).
Temporal features (day, month, weekday, season).

3.Train-test split for forecasting

Example: Train (2018–2022), Test (2023).
